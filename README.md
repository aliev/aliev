## Hi, I'm Ali 👋

I build pragmatic, scalable systems at the intersection of AI and distributed architecture.

Currently working on:

- 🧠 [Vision Agents](https://github.com/getstream/Vision-Agents) at [Stream](https://github.com/GetStream)
- 🔐 [aioauth](https://github.com/aliev/aioauth) — Asynchronous OAuth 2.0 framework for Python
- 🥖 [baker](https://github.com/aliev/baker) — Project templating tool written in Rust

Interests: AI infrastructure · Distributed Systems · Pragmatic Architecture · Open Source
